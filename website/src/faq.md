# FAQ

## How do I choose the claim of my attack?

You can test your attack on the `fk0` dataset. If you did not train on it, then
the number of traces needed to attack `fk0` is *a priori* not different that
the one needed to attack `fk1`.

That being said, for a given attack algorithm, some keys might be easier to
break than some others, and maybe `fk1` is easier or harder than `fk0` for your
attack.
You can submit multiple times your attack within the embargo period of the
first submission to adjust your claim, depending on the key rank you get at
<https://submit.smaesh-challenge.simple-crypto.org/submissions/my_attacks>.

Whether you start conservatively and improve, or start aggressive then back off is your choice!
