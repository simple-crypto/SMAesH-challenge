## Post-CHES challenge

After the CHES challenge, the test datasets have been released (as well as the profiling randomness for the `S6_d2` dataset).

We invite everybody who works with the dataset to report their attacks to [the challenge organizers](mailto:info@simple-crypto.dev) (paper and/or code link). We aim to maintain here a list of all public attacks on the dataset.
Ideally, attack code should work within the [evaluation framework](./framework.md), in order to ease reproduction.

### Following challenge rules

To qualify, an attack should have been trained only on the training and validation datasets, and evaluated on a test dataset (taking the first \\(x\\) traces of that dataset).

| Target | Authors | Attack | Traces | Use prof. RNG seed |
| :----: | ------- | ------ | :----: | :----------------: |

### Other attacks

We list here the attacks that we are aware of, but that do not follow the challenge rules.
